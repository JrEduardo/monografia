Event counts are dependent variables that can take on only nonnegative integer values, such as the number of wars or coups d'etat in a year. I discuss several generalizations of the Poisson regression model, presented in King (1988), to allow for substantively interesting stochastic processes that do not fit into the Poisson framework. Individual models that cope with, and help analyze, heterogeneity, contagion, and negative contagion are each shown to lead to specific statistical models for event count data. In addition, I derive a new generalized event count (GEC) model that enables researchers to extract significant amounts of new information from existing data by estimating features of these unobserved substantive processes. Applications of this model to congressional challenges of presidential vetoes and superpower conflict demonstrate the dramatic advantages of this approach.},

abstract = {Excess zeroes are often thought of as a cause of data over-dispersion (i.e. when the variance exceeds the mean); this claim is not entirely accurate. In actuality, excess zeroes reduce the mean of a dataset, thus inflating the dispersion index (i.e. the variance divided by the mean). While this results in an increased chance for data over-dispersion, the implication is not guaranteed. Thus, one should consider a flexible distribution that not only can account for excess zeroes, but can also address potential over- or under-dispersion. A zero-inflated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (ZICMP) regression allows for modeling the relationship between explanatory and response variables, while capturing the effects due to excess zeroes and dispersion. This work derives the ZICMP model and illustrates its flexibility, extrapolates the corresponding likelihood ratio test for the presence of significant data dispersion, and highlights various statistical properties and model fit through several examples.},

abstract = {Developing sound or reliable statistical models for analyzing motor vehicle crashes is very important in highway safety studies. However, a significant difficulty associated with the model development is related to the fact that crash data often exhibit over-dispersion. Sources of dispersion can be varied and are usually unknown to the transportation analysts. These sources could potentially affect the development of negative binomial (NB) regression models, which are often the model of choice in highway safety. To help in this endeavor, this paper documents an alternative formulation that could be used for capturing heterogeneity in crash count models through the use of finite mixture regression models. The finite mixtures of Poisson or NB regression models are especially useful where count data were drawn from heterogeneous populations. These models can help determine sub-populations or groups in the data among others. To evaluate these models, Poisson and NB mixture models were estimated using data collected in Toronto, Ontario. These models were compared to standard NB regression model estimated using the same data. The results of this study show that the dataset seemed to be generated from two distinct sub-populations, each having different regression coefficients and degrees of over-dispersion. Although over-dispersion in crash data can be dealt with in a variety of ways, the mixture model can help provide the nature of the over-dispersion in the data. It is therefore recommended that transportation safety analysts use this type of model before the traditional NB model, especially when the data are suspected to belong to different groups.},

abstract = {The objective of this article is to evaluate the performance of the COM-Poisson GLM for analyzing crash data exhibiting underdispersion (when conditional on the mean). The COM-Poisson distribution, originally developed in 1962, has recently been reintroduced by statisticians for analyzing count data subjected to either over- or underdispersion. Over the last year, the COM-Poisson GLM has been evaluated in the context of crash data analysis and it has been shown that the model performs as well as the Poisson-gamma model for crash data exhibiting overdispersion. To accomplish the objective of this study, several COM-Poisson models were estimated using crash data collected at 162 railway-highway crossings in South Korea between 1998 and 2002. This data set has been shown to exhibit underdispersion when models linking crash data to various explanatory variables are estimated. The modeling results were compared to those produced from the Poisson and gamma probability models documented in a previous published study. The results of this research show that the COM-Poisson GLM can handle crash data when the modeling output shows signs of underdispersion. Finally, they also show that the model proposed in this study provides better statistical performance than the gamma probability and the traditional Poisson models, at least for this data set.},

O crescente interesse pela {\'{a}}rea motivou a realiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de v{\'{a}}rios encontros informais no in{\'{i}}cio dos anos 80, a maioria deles na Inglaterra, at{\'{e}} que em 1986 foi realizado na cidade de Innsbruck na {\'{A}}ustria o “1st Internati- onalWorkshop on Statistical Modelling”(1st IWSM). Esse encontro tem sido realizado anualmente sendo que o {\'{u}}ltimo (25th IWSM) aconteceu em julho de 2010 na Universidade de Glasgow, Esc{\'{o}}cia. O 26th IWSM ser{\'{a}} realizado em julho de 2011 em Val{\^{e}}ncia, Espanha. No Brasil a {\'{a}}rea come{\c{c}}ou efetiva- mente a se desenvolver a partir de meados da d{\'{e}}cada de 80 e em particular ap{\'{o}}s a 1a Escola de Modelos de Regress{\~{a}}o (1EMR) realizada na Universi- dade de S{\~{a}}o Paulo em 1989. As demais escolas ocorreram desde ent{\~{a}}o a cada dois anos sendo que a {\'{u}}ltima (11EMR) foi realizada em mar{\c{c}}o de 2009 na cidade de Recife, PE. A 12EMR ser{\'{a}} realizada em mar{\c{c}}o de 2011 na cidade de Fortaleza, CE.},

abstract = {A useful discrete distribution (the Conway2013Maxwell2013Poisson distribution) is revived and its statistical and probabilistic properties are introduced and explored. This distribution is a two-parameter extension of the Poisson distribution that generalizes some well-known discrete distributions (Poisson, Bernoulli and geometric). It also leads to the generalization of distributions derived from these discrete distributions (i.e. the binomial and negative binomial distributions). We describe three methods for estimating the parameters of the Conway2013Maxwell2013Poisson distribution. The first is a fast simple weighted least squares method, which leads to estimates that are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. The second method, using maximum likelihood, can be used to refine the initial estimates. This method requires iterations and is more computationally intensive. The third estimation method is Bayesian. Using the conjugate prior, the posterior density of the parameters of the Conway2013Maxwell2013Poisson distribution is easily computed. It is a flexible distribution that can account for overdispersion or underdispersion that is commonly encountered in count data. We also explore two sets of real world data demonstrating the flexibility and elegance of the Conway2013Maxwell2013Poisson distribution in fitting count data which do not seem to follow the Poisson distribution.},

@article{Sellers2010,
abstract = {Poisson regression is a popular tool for modeling count data and is applied in a vast array of applications from the social to the physical sciences and beyond. Real data, however, are often over- or under-dispersed and, thus, not conducive to Poisson regression. We propose a regression model based on the Conway--Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution to address this problem. The COM-Poisson regression generalizes the well-known Poisson and logistic regression models, and is suitable for fitting count data with a wide range of dispersion levels. With a GLM approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a COM-Poisson regression over a standard Poisson regression. We compare the COM-Poisson to several alternatives and illustrate its advantages and usefulness using three data sets with varying dispersion.},
